Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

# Dual-Graph Context Policy

This project uses a local dual-graph MCP server for efficient context retrieval.

## MANDATORY: Always follow this order

1. **Call `graph_continue` first** — before any file exploration, grep, or code reading.

2. **If `graph_continue` returns `needs_project=true`**: call `graph_scan` with the
   current project directory (`pwd`). Do NOT ask the user.

3. **If `graph_continue` returns `skip=true`**: project has fewer than 5 files.
   Do NOT do broad or recursive exploration. Read only specific files if their names
   are mentioned, or ask the user what to work on.

4. **Read `recommended_files`** using `graph_read` — **one call per file**.
   - `graph_read` accepts a single `file` parameter (string). Call it separately for each
     recommended file. Do NOT pass an array or batch multiple files into one call.
   - `recommended_files` may contain `file::symbol` entries (e.g. `src/auth.ts::handleLogin`).
     Pass them verbatim to `graph_read(file: "src/auth.ts::handleLogin")` — it reads only
     that symbol's lines, not the full file.
   - Example: if `recommended_files` is `["src/auth.ts::handleLogin", "src/db.ts"]`,
     call `graph_read(file: "src/auth.ts::handleLogin")` and `graph_read(file: "src/db.ts")`
     as two separate calls (they can be parallel).

5. **Check `confidence` and obey the caps strictly:**
   - `confidence=high` -> Stop. Do NOT grep or explore further.
   - `confidence=medium` -> If recommended files are insufficient, call `fallback_rg`
     at most `max_supplementary_greps` time(s) with specific terms, then `graph_read`
     at most `max_supplementary_files` additional file(s). Then stop.
   - `confidence=low` -> Call `fallback_rg` at most `max_supplementary_greps` time(s),
     then `graph_read` at most `max_supplementary_files` file(s). Then stop.

## Token Usage

A `token-counter` MCP is available for tracking live token usage.

- To check how many tokens a large file or text will cost **before** reading it:
  `count_tokens({text: "<content>"})`
- To log actual usage after a task completes (if the user asks):
  `log_usage({input_tokens: <est>, output_tokens: <est>, description: "<task>"})`
- To show the user their running session cost:
  `get_session_stats()`

Live dashboard URL is printed at startup next to "Token usage".

## Rules

- Do NOT use `rg`, `grep`, or bash file exploration before calling `graph_continue`.
- Do NOT do broad/recursive exploration at any confidence level.
- `max_supplementary_greps` and `max_supplementary_files` are hard caps - never exceed them.
- Do NOT dump full chat history.
- Do NOT call `graph_retrieve` more than once per turn.
- After edits, call `graph_register_edit` with the changed files. Use `file::symbol` notation (e.g. `src/auth.ts::handleLogin`) when the edit targets a specific function, class, or hook.

## Context Store

Whenever you make a decision, identify a task, note a next step, fact, or blocker during a conversation, call `graph_add_memory`.

**To add an entry:**

```
graph_add_memory(type="decision|task|next|fact|blocker", content="one sentence max 15 words", tags=["topic"], files=["relevant/file.ts"])
```

**Do NOT write context-store.json directly** — always use `graph_add_memory`. It applies pruning and keeps the store healthy.

**Rules:**

- Only log things worth remembering across sessions (not every minor detail)
- `content` must be under 15 words
- `files` lists the files this decision/task relates to (can be empty)
- Log immediately when the item arises — not at session end

## Session End

When the user signals they are done (e.g. "bye", "done", "wrap up", "end session"), proactively update `CONTEXT.md` in the project root with:

- **Current Task**: one sentence on what was being worked on
- **Key Decisions**: bullet list, max 3 items
- **Next Steps**: bullet list, max 3 items

Keep `CONTEXT.md` under 20 lines total. Do NOT summarize the full conversation — only what's needed to resume next session.
